1-Bar Plot (species counts)
Each species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) has the same number of samples (50 each).
This makes the dataset well-balanced, which is great for classification.

2-Box Plot (sepal length by species)
Setosa flowers generally have smaller sepal lengths.
Virginica flowers have the largest sepal lengths.
Versicolor is in the middle, overlapping partly with both.

3-KDE Plot (petal length)
Setosa has a distinctly smaller petal length, separated from the other two.
Versicolor and Virginica overlap more, but Virginica tends to have longer petals overall.

4-Violin Plot (petal width by species)
Setosa again shows a clear separation with very small petal widths.
Versicolor and Virginica overlap, but Virginica is skewed towards larger widths.

5-Swarm Plot (sepal width by species)
Sepal width is less useful for separation because there is significant overlap across all three species.
However, Setosa tends to have slightly higher sepal widths compared to others.
